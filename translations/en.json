		"policy": "Internet privacy is a right. Why should we accept that we wouldn't accept in our daily life (offline) ? For many years, private companies such as Google, Facebook, etc... as well as government agencies spy on us to gather informations about us everyday on the web. However, we are able to counter this mass spying using cryptography but too few projects allow us to protect us properly. But today, we are fortunate to have a safe alternative for our mails: <span>ProtonMail</span>, which allows encryption end-to-end thereof. Also, you can use <span>Ring.cx</span> or <span>Tox.chat</span> to encrypt your conversations.<br />It's in this perspective that we launched the development of <span>Muonium</span>, to offer an alternative for storing securely your documents online. Our policy requires us to encrypt end-to-end files making you the only true owner thereof.",

The principle is quite simple: You enter <b>your login/mail and password</b> and submit, this is the first security layer. Once you're logged, you need to enter <b>your passphrase</b> to be able to decrypt your key, then allows the decryption of your files, this corresponds to the second layer. But we thought that an additional layer provides more security. After your passphrase, <b>a mail with a code will be send</b>, you need to enter the received code on the page to be totally logged. All this may be a little long, but strengthens the security of your account.<br />This system is inspired by the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication'>double-authentification</a> made by some sites like Gmail or Facebook."
