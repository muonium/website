          <h3>I lost my password, how can I recover it ?</h3>
          <p>If this is your identification password, then click on "Forgot password?" on the login page. Your password will be reset and an email will be sent with a temporary password.
However, if this is your decryption password, it's impossible for us to redefine one and you must consider that all your files are lost.</p>

          <h3>Who can access my files ?</h3>
          <p>Only you can access your files. Without technical terms, you need a key (the "passphrase") to encrypt and decrypt your files. Thus, nobody, not even we, can access your files, you apart.

          <h3>How my files are encrypted ?</h3>
          <p>our files are encrypted end-to-end thanks to <a href="http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/">SJCL</a> at your browser using your personal key, also decrypted in your browser. Thus, data that are sent are already encrypted and nobody else except you can decrypt them.</p>

          <h3>Are you trying to help terrorists or evil organizations ?</h3>
          <p>No, we advocate privacy, certainly helping the world get a better privacy, we unwittingly helping terrorism. But we're in the same situation as <a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/privacy-encryption-and-terrorism/">ProtonMail</a>. In any case, even if we wouldn't develop Muonium, terrorists and any other person or group of people will encrypt their data.</p>
