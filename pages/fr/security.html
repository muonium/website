          <h3 class="text-center">Communications encryption</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>Muonium uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#TLS_1.2">TLS 1.2</a> technology with a certificate generated by <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> to secure communications between your devices and servers. With this technology, the information you send (your username, password, etc ...) and receive (personal information, etc ...) are encrypted using an algorithm named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES-256</a> allowing an encryption by <b>AES - 256 bits</b>.<br>So, even if your communications are intercepted, they can't be decrypted and no one can steal the information in transit between you and the servers.</p>

          <h3 class="text-center">Files encryption</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>We use end-to-end encryption. This means that whatever the stage (upload, storage, download), your file will still be encrypted. Thus, if someone intercept the communications, the attacker will never read your files. The encryption algorithm used is <b>AES</b> with <a href="http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/">SJCL</a> (which is a complete and open source implementation of AES) which allows a <b>256 bits encryption (equivalent of more RSA 2048)</b>. When creating an account, the user defines one personal passphrase (it's a password) in order to encrypt and decrypt his files. With this principle, we can't decrypt your files. When you are logging, your passphrase will be stored in your browser to enable the encryption and decryption locally. This keeps the file encrypted at any level (client, Internet, server).</p>

          <h3 class="text-center">Under the European and Estonian laws</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>Estonian cryptography laws aren't restrictive, that's why Muonium will be deployed in Estonia.	</p>

          <h3 class="text-center">Triple-authentification</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>Only you can access to your files. That is why we have developed a <b>authentication system with 3 layers</b>. The principle is quite simple: You enter <b>your login/mail and password</b> and submit, this is the first security layer. Once you're logged, you need to enter <b>your passphrase</b> to be able to decrypt your key, then allows the decryption of your files, this corresponds to the second layer. But we thought that an additional layer provides more security. After your passphrase, <b>a mail with a code will be send</b>, you need to enter the received code on the page to be totally logged. All this may be a little long, but strengthens the security of your account.<br>This system is inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">double-authentification</a> made by some sites like Gmail or Facebook.</p>
